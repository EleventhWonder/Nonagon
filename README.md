This is a Project that I will be updating with random code (either startups, things I have written far back, or simple snippets of my Daily Coding Quota) as I go. 

My plan is to look back and track my improvement as well as store code that I can reuse. I have had several harddrive failure causing data lost.

Update (10/31/2016):

I've been working on sites such as: www.melanieawong.com, evergreenandbloom (eb.freddycheungh.com - a rebranding is required since the client is changing the company's name), a custom error pages (http://freddycheungh.com/error), and my main page http://freddycheungh.com.
