This plugin was created during my first days with JavaScript (zero to no knowledge with language). Yes, this is one of the worst way to accomplish such simple task … 
As I’ve gotten better with JavaScript, I’ve taken some time to develop an improved version of this plugin (Still to be completed). 

Its main purpose is to format a currency amount within an input text box. Back then, I was given the task to research on a number masking plugin, but many peers didn’t like 
the amount of external sources we were using (this was making our code hard to maintain) so I decided to create a simple plugin that would meet simple requirements.

The plugin can mask rates, percentages, year, and numbers (only).

NOTE: A rewrite has been started – it has improved its speed and how the fields is being operated in the background. It will be uploaded as NumberMasker_V2.js in the near future.
