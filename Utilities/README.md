This folder will contain random stuff I'll be creating as I dive deeper into my learning adventures. 

Yes! some stuff will be overlapping and you may find something similar out there that functions the same. One of the common question I can 
think right of my head is: 

* Why did you make the routing.js if there's AngularJS that does the layer separation for you - includes rerouting views?

Well, the purpose of this project in general is to learn. I as an individual love to learn, therefore, when doing something like this, I
will challenge myself and not use Google to find the answers.

Looking back, I'll be able to keep track on my improvements as a programmer.
