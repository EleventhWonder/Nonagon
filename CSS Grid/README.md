After using multiple css frameworks such as bootstrap, foundation, and kendo - I decided to create a simple css grid system based on my own set of requirements.

I am a big fan of Vanilla code, therefore I will try to add on to this as I keep developing. 

* You may ask, why reinvent the wheel? 

One of the main goal I am trying to accomplish with this is to educate myself, as I will learn more complex SASS and LESS semantics while I expand on this project. I will also learn best practices, in terms of how the browser
handles certain attributes better than other.
