Music Player Plugin

This is a plugin developed for myself by myself. The intent was to create a easy to access and pleasent music player on my browser. This project is meant for learning new concepts and expanding my knowledge in how music players work in dept - It will eventually help me bring together my future game. Carrying on, i'll break down this project into pieces:

Stage 1: 

Skeleton will be done. Basic CSS and JavaScript will be implemented as well as the manifest.json and the required HTML to display. During this stage the play and pause will work but not the music length tracker.

Stage 2:

The music length tracker will function properly. Background run will be added in (this means if it's minimized, it will still play the song). 

Stage 3: 

A filepath will be provided, where you will be able to choose a list of songs (playlist) and play them as you go.

Future Functionalities: TBD
